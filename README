1. Introduction
===============================================================

TestLink is a web based test management and test execution system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test 
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. These test plans 
allow team members to execute test cases and track test results 
dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. All of the source code 
behind TestLink is freely available for download via SourceForge 
at http://www.sourceforge.net If you are interested in contributing 
to the TestLink effort feel free to contact us.
There is no hidden fee - 100% free for using!


2. Release notes
===============================================================

This is release candidate of final and stable release and we recommend 
to update from older version.

New features within 1.8: 
    * TestLink API - XML/RPC support for get Test results from scripts/external tools.
    * User audit (logging browsable via GUI)
    * Test prioritization re-implementation and improvement
    * Basic support for test automation (this feature will be enhanced later) 
    
See CHANGELOG file for detailed list.


3. System Requirements
===============================================================

- web-server: Apache(recommended), IIS
- PHP 5.2
- DBMS: MySQL 4.1 , Postgres 8.x , MS-SQL 2000

Versions above are minimal and could be higher.    


4. Installation
===============================================================
The following details the basic steps for installation on any   
system. The instructions may seem unix-centric but should work  
fine on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes 
to install, configure, and be using TestLink.

Short summary:
 1. Transfer files
 2. Uncompress files
 3. Launch web based installer

1. First, transfer the file to your web-server using whatever 
method you like best (ftp, scp, etc).  You will need to telnet/ssh 
into the server machine for the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Total Commander, Winzip, and other programs should also be able 
to handle decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something 
different to 'testlink'.

3. Launch web based installer
We will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file. From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/ 
or similar URL and follow instructions.

Check Installation manual and TestLink forum if you meet a problem.


5. Upgrade and Migration
===============================================================
When accessing Installer page you will found following options:

 - New Installation
 - Upgrade Database (not applicable in 1.8 version)
 - Migration from 1.6.2 to 1.7.x
 - Migration from 1.7.2 (or greater) to 1.8

 Steps
 - Make a Backup of your current database.
 - Using  a NEW DIRECTORY (DO NOT OVERWRITE your old installation),  
   do only following steps from Install procedure:
                                           Transfer files
                                           Uncompress files
 - Copy your old config_db.inc.php to NEW DIRECTORY.
 - Launch TestLink
 - TestLink will check Database version, and if some upgrade/migration 
   is needed will launch automatically the installer.

 If you are updating a same major version (for example 1.7.0 to 1.7.1) 
 you need to use Upgrade Database.
 
 If you are using a different major version detailed in options,  
 you need to use the specific Migrations.
 
 If in some steps TestLink ask you for two databases, NEVER use 
 same name from both.
 
 If you do not find nothing useful, post in forum
   
 Always before login, after an upgrade/migration clear browser cookies.
