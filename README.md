## 1. Introduction

TestLink is a web based test management and test execution system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. These test plans
allow team members to execute test cases and track test results
dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. All of the source code
behind TestLink is freely available for download via [SourceForge][sou]
or [GitHub][hub]. If you are interested in contributing to the TestLink
effort feel free to contact us. There is no hidden fee - 100% free for
using!

In an ideal world, testing would be a pretty straightforward process.
A test team takes the product requirements, writes a test specification
document, reviews the tests, and then runs them all for each version of
the product. The team is composed of full-time staff, and everyone knows
exactly what is expected of them.

In practice, few organisations have that luxury. There is not time to run
all the tests on every product version - especially on fix-releases that
need to be rolled out quickly. Requirements are constantly changing, and
the tests have to be changed in step. Test staff come and go. There are
misunderstandings over who was supposed to run which tests, so some get
missed. Management suddenly wants a status update at seven in the evening.

In these situations you need the support of a test management tool, such
as TestLink. The purpose of TestLink is to answer questions such as:

- For which requirements do we still need to write or update test cases?
- Which tests do you want me to run for this version?
- How much progress have we made on testing this release?
- Which test cases are currently failing, and what are the errors?
- On which version was this group of test cases last run, and is it time we ran them again?
- And ultimately: is this version of the product fit for release?

TestLink helps you to keep the test process under control. It forms a
repository for requirements and test cases, and relates these to builds,
platforms and staff. You allocate tests to staff who carry them out and
record the results. A wide variety of reports provide information on what
has been done and what still needs to be done.

## 2. Release notes / CRITICAL Configuration Notes

This release contains bugfixes and enhancement for 1.9.19
See CHANGELOG file for detailed list of issues fixed.

Give a look also to:
https://github.com/TestLinkOpenSourceTRMS/testlink-code/wiki
https://github.com/TestLinkOpenSourceTRMS/testlink-documentation/wiki

### CRITICAL PHP.INI Settings

#### max_input_vars

**Available since PHP 5.3.9. Default value: 1000**

If you are going to have test plans with more than 100 test cases, it will
be CRITICAL to increase this value in order to avoid issues such as CRASH
or MALFUNCTION when adding test cases to test plan.

See [this forum post on max_input_vars][frm] or [this mantis issue][bug] for
details.

#### memory_limit

**Default value: 128MB**

If you are going to re-import an XML file to update its test case data, the
system might run out of memory. [The original issue][mem] was resolved with
a `memory_limit` value of 256MB.

### Oauth configuration

Since 1.9.17 there is new authorization method - using OAuth providers.
Authentication against multiple oauth providers is supported.
Currently it configured to work with Google OAuth and Github, but you can add
any OAuth server that support protocol 2.0 and 2-step authentication.

#### There are some restrictions in using OAuth:
1. OAuth should not be specified as Default Authentication method
2. If user does not exist in DB and you try to login through oauth - userID
will be saved to db with special auth type. And for secure reasons you can't
logon via regular email/password into Testlink.
3. If user already exists in DB then you can logon via password or via OAuth

#### To configure OAuth you should set in config provided by OAuth provider
 oauth_client_id - id of OAuth program
 oauth_client_secret - secret code
 oauth_grant_type - authorization_code is default value
 oauth_url - url of OAuth server
 token_url - url for getting token
 oauth_profile - url of OAuth profile page

 oauth_grant_type, oauth_scope - specific parameters for several OAuth providers. They are not necessary

### Changes on LDAP CONFIGURATION

Since 1.9.16 authentication against [Multiple LDAP Servers][ldap] is supported.
To implement this feature configuration parameters have been changed, as explained
here:

#### TestLink Version < 1.9.16

    $tlCfg->authentication['method'] = 'LDAP';

    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_server'] = 'ldap.xyz.com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_port'] = '389';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_version'] = '3';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_root_dn'] = 'dc=xyz,dc=com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_bind_dn'] = 'uid=tl,ou=staff,dc=xyz,dc=com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_bind_passwd'] = 'XYZw';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap_tls'] = false; // true -> use tls

#### TestLink Version >= 1.9.16

    $tlCfg->authentication['method'] = 'LDAP';

    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_server'] = 'ldap.xyz.com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_port'] = '389';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_version'] = '3';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_root_dn'] = 'dc=xyz,dc=com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_bind_dn'] = 'uid=tl,ou=staff,dc=xyz,dc=com';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_bind_passwd'] = 'XYZw';
    $tlCfg->authentication['ldap'][1]['ldap_tls'] = false;


## 3. System Requirements - server

Server environment should consist of:
- web-server: Apache 2.x
- PHP > 5.5 It will be better if you use PHP 7.2.x 
- PHP IMPORTANTE NOTICE: next TestLink Version will require minimum PHP 7.3.x
-       
- DBMS
  - MySQL 5.7.x
    - The `log_bin_trust_function_creators` option must be enabled.
  - MariaDB 10.1.x
    - The `log_bin_trust_function_creators` option must be enabled.
  - Postgres 9.x
  - MS-SQL 201x -> SUPPORT IS INCOMPLETE

Tested on web-browsers:
- Firefox
- Chrome

ATTENTION: we have not enough resources to test on all kind of browsers.
           Right now development is done using Chrome & Firefox.

## 4. Installation & SECURITY

The following details the basic steps for installation on any system.
Instructions may seem unix-centric but should work on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes
to install, configure, and start using TestLink.

Short summary:
 1. Transfer files
 2. Uncompress files
 3. Launch web based installer

1. First, transfer the file to your web-server using whatever method
you like best (ftp, scp, etc).

You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.

The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Total Commander, Winzip, and other programs should also be able
to handle decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something
different to 'testlink'.

### SECURITY

You need to configure:

- log directory 	(`$tlCfg->log_path`)
- upload directory  (`$g_repositoryPath`)

According to your installation, default values provided. However, these are
examples **THAT DO NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX**.

Take a look at [bug 5147][5147], [bug 5148][5148], [bug 4977][4977] and
[bug 4906][4906].

You should also need to configure write access for logging, upload and
template directories.


### SELINUX 
If you use Linux Operating System, SELINUX can create some issues:  

**ATTENTION with /var/www/html and selinux**  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45311124/directory-is-not-writable-centos7-apache-2-4-6-php-5-4-16  

If SELINUX is enabled you will need to run following command before been able to adjust folder rights   
*[root@dogbert ~]\# chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/*

You may find more information searching in the Internet:  
TestLink & SELINUX  
** FCKEDITOR UPLOAD **

**ATTENTION: We now use CKEDITOR** (see [forum post][cke])

3. Launch web based installer
We will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file. From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/
or similar URL and follow instructions.

Check Installation manual and TestLink forum if you meet a problem.

## 5. Upgrade and Migration

When accessing Installer page you will find only the **new installation**
option. The migration **has to be done manually** for these special cases:

- Upgrade from 1.9.3 to 1.9.4/5/6/7/../16/17/18/19
- Upgrade from 1.9.4/5 to 1.9.7
- Upgrade from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8
- Migration from other releases than 1.9.3

### General Steps
1. Make a backup of your current database.
2. Using a **new directory** (**DO NOT OVERWRITE** your old installation),
   do only following steps from Install procedure:
       - Transfer files
       - Uncompress files
 - Copy your old `config_db.inc.php` and `custom_config.inc.php` over to the
   **new directory**.
 - Launch TestLink
 - TestLink will check the database version. If some upgrade/migration is
   needed, it will launch automatically the installer.

 If you are updating a same major version (for example 1.7.0 to 1.7.1) you
 need to use *Upgrade Database*.

**Please look at [MANTIS 6594][6594]**: Migration scripts don't cover test
case steps and expected results, also test case ID's are empty in GUI

 If you are using a different major version detailed in options, you need
 to use the specific Migrations.

 If in some steps TestLink asks you for two databases, **never** use the
 same name for both.

 If you find nothing useful, post in the forum.

 Always before login, after an upgrade/migration, clear browser cookies.

14. Migration from other releases before 1.9.3

You have always have to migrate one by one to each version that is newer
than yours. Extreme example: migration from 1.7.4

    1.7.4 => 1.7.5 => 1.8.1 => 1.8.2 => 1.8.3 => 1.8.4 => 1.8.5 => 1.9.0
    1.9.0 => 1.9.1 => 1.9.2 => 1.9.3 => 1.9.4 => 1.9.5 => 1.9.6 => 1.9.7 =>
    1.9.8 => 1.9.9 => 1.9.10 => 1.9.11 => 1.9.12 => 1.9.13 => 1.9.14 =>
    1.9.15 => 1.9.16 => 1.9.17 => 1.9.18 => 1.9.19 => 1.9.20

You have to read carefully README and instructions (if any) provided by
installer. Sometimes version changes do not require actions on DB structure
or data.

## 13. JIRA DB interface changes

  - TICKET 6028: Integration with Jira 6.1 broken.
    (Due to JIRA schema changes)
    Contribution by adnkoks

You need to change your xml configuration in TestLink to add a **new MANDATORY
property**:

    <jiraversion></jiraversion>

Without this property TestLink **WILL CRASH** => this is a desired behaviour

## 14. People/Companies supporting TestLink

  - Bitnami: provided a VM on Cloud to do tests

  - Team Cortado (Germany): paid for custom development of a long-awaited
    feature: execution notes & results for test steps, **donating** feature
    to community (it is not the first time they are doing this!)

  - MAMP PRO

  - [Hitek School][hitek]: Group of students helped to test TestLink

  - [Wellington Institute of Technology][welt]: Group of students working on
    creating automation infrastructure to test TestLink

  - [CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet][csrf]

## 15. Use forum.testlink.org

Information has been collected with users' help

[FAQ & HINTS][faqh]

[TestLink 1.9.4 and greater, News, changes, etc][194n]

[How to get the answer (self service)][howa]

## 16. User cries: I WANT HELP !!!

Relax, as usual I've to say the resources are limited,
that this effort is not supported by a company or a foundation
but is result of usage of free time.

Guidelines for getting help and/or solving a situation are what I use everyday:
First try for yourself searching on:
  - mantis.testlink.org
  - forum.testlink.org
  - https://github.com/TestLinkOpenSourceTRMS/testlink-documentation/wiki/Execution-Feature---Configuration
  - https://github.com/TestLinkOpenSourceTRMS/testlink-documentation/wiki/Execution-Feature---Test-Step-Execution-configuration

Please do not operate on lazy mode: just asking.
First thing will be always asked will be:
- have you already did some searches ?

When you report a potential issue on a TestLink version,
first thing that will be requested will be the 30minTest:
- get latest code from github, do fresh install, retest & provide feedback.

Do not send PRIVATE email to ask for things that have to be PUBLIC, this is
a bad approach. Use PRIVATE CHANNELS only on Dev Team Request.

If you need more specialized help, it can be provided if you pay for it.

## 17. Use Mantis documentation

[CHANGE LOG][chgl]

[TICKET][7817] with available fixes for latest stable version (1.9.16)

## 18. Link to GITORIOUS COMMITS

Some time ago we **migrated from Gitorious** (thanks a lot for all the years
of free repo) **to Github**. On tickets or documentation that belong to the
Gitorious era, you will find **links to commits that are not accessible any
more as-is**.

But accessing **the same commits in Github** (the commit IDs do not change) is
just a matter of understanding **how to change the URL Part** that is present
BEFORE the commit ID. => then Nike => Just DO IT
