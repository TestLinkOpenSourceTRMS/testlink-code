<h2>General</h2>

<p>This feature allows to map a coverage of user or system requirements by
test cases. Navigate via link "Requirement Specification" in main screen.</p>

<h2>Requirements Specification</h2>

<p>Requirements are grouped by "Requirements Specification" which is related to 
Test Project.<br /> TestLink doesn't support versions for both Requirements Specification  
and Requirements itself. So, version of document should be added after 
a Specification <b>Title</b>.
An user can add simple description or notes to <b>Scope</b> field.</p> 

<p><b><a name="total_count">Total count</a></b> of all Requirements serves for 
evaluation Req. coverage in case that not all requirements are added to TestLink. 
The value <b>n/a</b> means that current count of requirements is used
for metrics.</p> 
<p><i>E.g. SRS includes 200 requirements but only 50 are added in TestLink. Test 
coverage is 25% (if all these added requirements will be tested).</i></p>

<h2><a name="req">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>Click on title of a created Requirements Specification. You can create, edit, delete
or import requirements for the document. Each requirement has title, scope and status.
Status should be "Normal" or "Not testable". Not testable requirements are not counted
to metrics. This parameter should be used for both unimplemented features and 
wrong designed requirements.</p> 

<p>You can create new test cases for requirements by using multi action with checked 
requirements within the specification screen. These Test Cases are created into component and
category 'TODO'. Title and Scope are copied to these test cases.</p>
