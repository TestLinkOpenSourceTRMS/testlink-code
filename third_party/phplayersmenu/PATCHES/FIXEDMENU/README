
This patch allows to keep the horizontal menu in a fixed position
when the page is scrolled; load example-hormenu.php and scroll the page:
if you have loaded the page with a modern browser (not with MS Internet
Explorer...), you will see that the menu bar stays fixed at the top
of the page.

Some clarifications about the browsers' compatibility of this page...

Konqueror 2.2
-------------
This page breaks compatibility with Konqueror 2.2.

Internet Explorer for MS Windows
--------------------------------
This patch does not affect compatibility with IE for MS Windows, it is
completely ignored by IE; in other words, application of this patch
does not change at all the menu behaviour on IE, i.e. it has no effect
on it; the feature provided by this patch is not implemented for IE
for a very simple reason: in the third millenium, IE is the only browser
that does not implement a very elementar CSS property, i.e.
'position: fixed;'.

Internet Explorer 5.2.3 for MacOSX
----------------------------------
AFAIK, this patch breaks compatibility with IE 5.2.3 for MacOSX.
