- The odbc_mssql driver now sets CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL OFF for compat with mssql driver.

## 3.50 - 19 May 2003

- ADOdb sessions using oracle clobs contributed by achim.gosse#ddd.de. See adodb-session-clob.php.

- Added time format support for SQLDate.
- Image => B added to metatype.
- MetaType now checks empty($this->blobSize) instead of empty($this).
- Datadict has beta support for informix, sybase (mapped to mssql), db2 and generic (which is a fudge).

## 3.40 - 19 May 2003

- Added insert_id for odbc_mssql.
- Modified postgresql UpdateBlobFile() because it did not work in safe mode.
- Now connection object is passed to raiseErrorFn as last parameter. Needed by StartTrans().
- Added StartTrans() and CompleteTrans(). It is recommended that you do not modify transOff, but use the above functions.
- oci8po now obeys ADODB_ASSOC_CASE settings.
- Added virtualized error codes, using PEAR DB equivalents. Requires you to manually include adodb-error.inc.php yourself, with MetaError() and MetaErrorMsg($errno).
- GetRowAssoc for mysql and pgsql were flawed. Fix by Ross Smith.
- Added to datadict types I1, I2, I4 and I8\. Changed datadict type 'T' to map to timestamp instead of datetime for postgresql.
- Error handling in ExecuteSQLArray(), adodb-datadict.inc.php did not work.

## 3.31 - 17 March 2003

- Added row checking for _fetch in postgres.
- Added Interval type to MetaType for postgres.
- Remapped postgres driver to call postgres7 driver internally.
- Adorecordset_array::getarray() did not return array when nRows >= 0.
- Postgresql: at times, no error message returned by pg_result_error() but error message returned in pg_last_error(). Recoded again.
- Interbase blob's now use chunking for updateblob.
- Move() did not set EOF correctly. Reported by Jorma T.
- We properly support mysql timestamp fields when we are creating mysql tables using the data-dict interface.
- Table regex includes backticks character now.

## 3.30 - 3 March 2003

- Added $ADODB_EXTENSION and $ADODB_COMPAT_FETCH constant.
- Made blank1stItem configurable using syntax "value:text" in GetMenu/GetMenu2. Thx to Gabriel Birke.
- Previously ADOdb differed from the Microsoft standard because it did not define what to set $this->fields when EOF was reached. Now at EOF, ADOdb sets $this->fields to false for all databases, which is consist with Microsoft's implementation. Postgresql and mysql have always worked this way (in 3.11 and earlier). If you are experiencing compatibility problems (and you are not using postgresql nor mysql) on upgrading to 3.30, try setting the global variables $ADODB_COUNTRECS = true (which is the default) and $ADODB_FETCH_COMPAT = true (this is a new global variable).
- We now check both pg_result_error and pg_last_error as sometimes pg_result_error does not display anything. Iman Mayes
- We no longer check for magic quotes gpc in Quote().
- Misc fixes for table creation in adodb-datadict.inc.php. Thx to iamsure.
- Time calculations use adodb_time library for all negative timestamps due to problems in Red Hat 7.3 or later. Formerly, only did this for Windows.
- In mssqlpo, we now check if $sql in _query is a string before we change || to +. This is to support prepared stmts.
- Move() and MoveLast() internals changed to support to support EOF and $this->fields change.
- Added ADODB_FETCH_BOTH support to mssql. Thx to Angel Fradejas afradejas#mediafusion.es
- We now check if link resource exists before we run mysql_escape_string in qstr().
- Before we flock in csv code, we check that it is not a http url.

## 3.20 - 17 Feb 2003

- Added new Data Dictionary classes for creating tables and indexes. Warning - this is very much alpha quality code. The API can still change. See adodb/tests/test-datadict.php for more info.
- We now ignore $ADODB_COUNTRECS for mysql, because PHP truncates incomplete recordsets when mysql_unbuffered_query() is called a second time.
- Now postgresql works correctly when $ADODB_COUNTRECS = false.
- Changed _adodb_getcount to properly support SELECT DISTINCT.
- Discovered that $ADODB_COUNTRECS=true has some problems with prepared queries - suspect PHP bug.
- Now GetOne and GetRow run in $ADODB_COUNTRECS=false mode for better performance.
- Added support for mysql_real_escape_string() and pg_escape_string() in qstr().
- Added an intermediate variable for mysql _fetch() and MoveNext() to store fields, to prevent overwriting field array with boolean when mysql_fetch_array() returns false.
- Made arrays for getinsertsql and getupdatesql case-insensitive. Suggested by Tim Uckun" tim#diligence.com

## 3.11 - 11 Feb 2003

- Added check for ADODB_NEVER_PERSIST constant in PConnect(). If defined, then PConnect() will actually call non-persistent Connect().
- Modified interbase to properly work with Prepare().

- Added support for $input_array parameter in CacheFlush().
- Added experimental support for dbx, which was then removed when i found that it was slower than using native calls.
- Added MetaPrimaryKeys for mssql and ibase/firebird.
- Added new $trim parameter to GetCol and CacheGetCol
- Uses updated adodb-time.inc.php 0.06.

## 3.10 - 27 Jan 2003

- For interbase, added code to handle unlimited number of bind parameters. From Daniel Hasan daniel#hasan.cl.
- Added BlobDecode and UpdateBlob for informix. Thx to Fernando Ortiz.
- Added constant ADODB_WINDOWS. If defined, means that running on Windows.
- Added constant ADODB_PHPVER which stores php version as a hex num. Removed $ADODB_PHPVER variable.
- Felho Bacsi reported a minor white-space regular expression problem in GetInsertSQL.
- Modified ADO to use variant to store _affectedRows
- Changed ibase to use base class Replace(). Modified base class Replace() to support ibase.
- Changed odbc to auto-detect when 0 records returned is wrong due to bad odbc drivers.
- Changed mssql to use datetimeconvert ini setting only when 4.30 or later (does not work in 4.23).
- ExecuteCursor($stmt, $cursorname, $params) now accepts a new $params array of additional bind parameters -- William Lovaton walovaton#yahoo.com.mx.
- Added support for sybase_unbuffered_query if ADODB_COUNTRECS == false. Thx to chuck may.
- Fixed FetchNextObj() bug. Thx to Jorma Tuomainen.
- We now use SCOPE_IDENTITY() instead of @@IDENTITY for mssql - thx to marchesini#eside.it
